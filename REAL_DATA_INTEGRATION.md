# üîÑ Real Order Data Integration Guide

## ‚úÖ What's Been Changed

### 1. App Configuration
- **Added `read_orders` scope** to `shopify.app.toml`
- Your app now has permission to access order data

### 2. Data Source Switch
- **Replaced mock data** with real Shopify order history
- **Fetches last 30 days** of order data for analysis
- **Graceful fallback** to mock data if no orders found

### 3. Enhanced GraphQL Queries
- **Real-time order fetching** with proper date filtering
- **Line item analysis** to calculate actual product sales
- **Error handling** for API limitations

## üöÄ How It Works Now

### Data Flow
1. **Query Orders**: Fetches orders from last 30 days using GraphQL
2. **Process Line Items**: Analyzes each order's line items for product quantities
3. **Calculate Velocity**: Converts total sales to daily/weekly/monthly rates
4. **Generate Forecasts**: Uses real sales velocity to predict stockouts

### Sales Calculation
```
Daily Sales = Total Product Sales (30 days) √∑ 30
Weekly Sales = Daily Sales √ó 7
Monthly Sales = Total Product Sales (30 days)
```

### Forecast Algorithm
```
Days Until Stockout = Current Inventory √∑ Daily Sales Rate
```

## üìä What You'll See

### With Real Order Data
- **Accurate forecasting** based on actual sales patterns
- **"Live Data"** badge indicating real information
- **Realistic sales velocities** from your store's history

### Without Order Data (Fallback)
- **Mock data** for stores with no recent orders
- **Realistic patterns** simulating typical sales behavior
- **Demo functionality** until real sales accumulate

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Next Steps

### 1. App Scope Update Required
Your app now requests the `read_orders` scope. You'll need to:

1. **Reinstall/Update** the app to get new permissions
2. **Merchant approval** may be required for the new scope
3. **Test with real data** once permissions are granted

### 2. Testing Process
```bash
# Restart your development server
shopify app dev

# Reinstall the app in your test store to get new permissions
# Navigate to the app to test real data integration
```

### 3. Verify Real Data Usage
Look for these indicators:
- ‚úÖ **"Real-Time Sales Forecasting"** banner (green)
- ‚úÖ **"Live Data"** badge in the product table
- ‚úÖ Console logs showing actual order processing

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Main Dashboard (`app._index.tsx`)
- **Orders Query**: Fetches 250 most recent orders from last 30 days
- **Batch Processing**: Analyzes all orders at once for efficiency
- **Product Matching**: Maps line items to products for sales calculation

### Low Inventory Page (`low-inventory.tsx`)
- **Per-Product Analysis**: Individual order queries for each product variant
- **Async Processing**: Handles multiple product analyses concurrently
- **Detailed Tracking**: More granular sales data per variant

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to mock data if orders unavailable
- **Permission Handling**: Manages cases where read_orders scope isn't granted
- **Logging**: Console output for debugging data source (real vs mock)

## üéØ Business Benefits

### Accurate Forecasting
- **Real sales patterns** instead of simulated data
- **Seasonal variations** reflected in forecasts
- **Product-specific trends** from actual customer behavior

### Inventory Optimization
- **Precise reorder timing** based on actual sales velocity
- **Reduced stockouts** from accurate predictions
- **Better cash flow** from optimized inventory levels

### Data-Driven Decisions
- **Historical performance** guides future planning
- **Sales trend analysis** for marketing insights
- **Product popularity** ranking from real sales data

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Advanced Analytics
- **Seasonal pattern recognition** from longer history
- **Growth trend analysis** month-over-month
- **Customer segment analysis** for different sales patterns

### Machine Learning Integration
- **Predictive modeling** using order patterns
- **Demand forecasting** beyond simple velocity
- **Anomaly detection** for unusual sales spikes

### Performance Optimization
- **Caching strategies** for frequently accessed data
- **Incremental updates** instead of full recalculation
- **Background processing** for large order volumes

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### No Real Data Showing?
1. **Check app permissions** - ensure `read_orders` scope is granted
2. **Verify order history** - store needs recent orders (last 30 days)
3. **Review console logs** - look for "Processing X orders" messages

### Performance Issues?
1. **Large order volumes** may slow initial load
2. **Consider pagination** for stores with many orders
3. **Implement caching** for production deployments

### Data Accuracy Concerns?
1. **Refunds/exchanges** not currently handled
2. **Cancelled orders** may affect calculations
3. **Consider order status filtering** for more accuracy

The app now uses real order data to provide accurate, actionable inventory forecasting based on your actual sales patterns! üéâ
