# 🔮 AI-Powered Stock Forecasting Features

## Overview
Enhanced the low stock alert app with intelligent forecasting capabilities that predict when products will run out of stock based on sales velocity analysis.

## 🆕 New Features

### 1. Sales Velocity Tracking
- **Multi-Period Analysis**: Daily, weekly, and monthly sales rates
- **Realistic Mock Data**: Simulates sales patterns based on current inventory levels
- **Dynamic Calculations**: Updates forecasts based on selected time period

### 2. Stockout Prediction
- **Days Until Stockout**: Calculates when products will run out at current sales rate
- **Status Classification**:
  - 🔴 **Critical**: 1-3 days until stockout
  - 🟡 **Warning**: 4-7 days until stockout  
  - 🟢 **Safe**: 8+ days until stockout
  - ⚪ **Unknown**: No sales data available

### 3. Enhanced User Interface
- **Professional DataTable**: Sortable columns with comprehensive product info
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded badges for quick status assessment
- **Interactive Tooltips**: Detailed sales velocity information on hover
- **Time Period Selector**: Switch between daily/weekly/monthly views
- **Forecast Legend**: Clear explanation of status meanings

## 📊 Data Sources

### Current Implementation
- **Mock Data**: Realistic simulated sales based on inventory patterns
- **Demo Purpose**: Shows forecasting capabilities without requiring additional permissions

### Production Ready
- **Real Sales Data**: Would use Shopify Orders API with `read_orders` scope
- **Historical Analysis**: 30-day sales history for accurate velocity calculations
- **Machine Learning**: Could be enhanced with seasonal patterns and trends

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Algorithm
```
Days Until Stockout = Current Stock ÷ Daily Sales Rate
```

### Status Logic
- Critical: ≤ 3 days
- Warning: 4-7 days  
- Safe: ≥ 8 days
- Unknown: No sales data

### Mock Data Generation
- Varies sales velocity based on current stock levels
- Higher stock = lower sales velocity (realistic pattern)
- Adds randomness for realistic variation
- Provides daily/weekly/monthly breakdowns

## 📱 User Experience

### Main Dashboard (`app._index.tsx`)
- Enhanced product table with forecasting columns
- Time period selector for flexible analysis
- Professional DataTable with sorting capabilities
- Informational banner explaining demo data

### Low Inventory Page (`low-inventory.tsx`)
- Added forecasting to existing categorized view
- Enhanced product cards with sales velocity
- Forecast badges with tooltip details
- Maintains existing critical/low/other categorization

## 🚀 Business Value
